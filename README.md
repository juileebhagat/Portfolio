## ðŸ’¡ My Experience Building This

While building this portfolio, I got hands-on experience with **Tailwind CSS utility classes**, creating responsive layouts, and designing with modern UI principles like **glassmorphism** and **hover interactions**. This project helped me better understand the power of Tailwind's design system and how to structure a professional personal site using only HTML and utility-first CSS.
